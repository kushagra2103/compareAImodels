This exercise is to create LLM as a judge. It will evaluate and compare responses from two other AI models. 

Model A: gpt-4o-mini \n
Model B: Gemini-2.0-flash \n
Model C (Judge) : GPT-4.1

Description: We first user Model A to come up with a challenging question to test the intelligence of LLMs. 
Then fed this question to both Model A and Model B as an input and used Model C to evaluate and rank the responses from Model A and Model B.
